#Rem
	DESCRIPTION:
		* This class is used to automate sharing of a single resource via a common object.
		
		Basically, this can be used with an 'AssetEntryManager', in order to reduce
		loading the same asset into memory many times over. This can be used alongside 'AssetEntryManager'
		in order to abstract the process of actually loading the asset. This means the loading process
		can be handled asynchronously, or in any kind of configuration needed.
	NOTES:
		* The 'ReferenceType' argument acts as the asset/resource type this entry represents.
		
		* The 'ExternalEntryType' argument should effectively be the exact same type as your inheriting class.
		Alternatively, this could be used for interface functionality.
		
		* Proper construction of 'AssetEntry' objects should be handled by inheriting classes.
		Because of this, this class does not have proper (Initial) constructors.
		The provided constructors are simply "pass-throughs" to the 'AssetManager' class.
		
		* All 'AssetEntry' objects also double as 'AssetManagers' themselves;
		this is done for the sake of standardized call-back management.
		
		* The "call-back" system this class employs may be used to manage active references
		to an object made from an inheriting class. This is completely implementation driven, however.

		Also take note that the internal call-back container may not exist when using this.

		The 'Build' command is partially abstracted from the synchronous/asynchronous structure.

		Explicitly requiring a 'ReferenceType' object to be output
		from this command is considered non-standard. Such

	DESCRIPTION:
		* 'ManagedAssetEntry' objects are objects that can be "built" by external objects.
		
		How this is handled is up to inheriting classes, but this
		class acts as an easy to use system for "managed entires".
	NOTES:
		* Internal "reference" generation is not needed when inheriting
		from this class, but it is recommended to do so when possible.
		
		This means that using 'Build', 'GenerateReference', and related
		"unmanaged" methods will result in undefined behavior. For details,
		please view the below documentation regarding 'GenerateReference'.
		
		* The 'ReferenceGenerator' argument is used to specify what type
		should be assumed as the type that will generate this object's
		"reference" (When using 'ManagedBuild', and similar commands).
		
		With that in mind, this can be handled "virtually" by using an interface, rather than
		a concrete implementation. Likewise, you could create a scheme which has this class
		implement this interface as well, letting it be its own "generator".

	#Rem
		The 'Generator' argument (Found on the "ManagedBuild" commands) is
		used to represent the 'ReferenceGenerator' object attempting to build this "entry".
		
		It is up to implementing classes if this should require a 'ReferenceGenerator' object or not.
		A general rule of thumb is to not bother requiring it, unless you intend to build
		a system which further abstracts the asset management process.
		
		As described above, one option is to use an interface as your 'ReferenceGenerator' argument.
		From there, you could have a "manager" class of some kind (Possibly based on 'AssetEntryManager'),
		which would generate the internal reference for this "entry". On top of that, you could implement
		that interface yourself, using your inheriting implementation of this class. Then you could simply
		use this object as your "generator" if one was not specified beforehand.
		
		Behavior is implementation-defined, and should be expected as such. "Managed builds" are not normal
		"builds", and they tend to be implemented using abstract systems (Interfaces, for example).

		These commands will default to calling the "managed" versions.
		This means we can't supply a 'ReferenceGenerator' object, so this class passes 'Null'.
		
		If your own 'ManagedAssetEntry' class can generate a default
		reference, it's best to use it here (By overriding these).
		
		A good example being if your inheriting class implements a common
		interface, in order to provide default behavior in these situations.
		
		Any class that inherits this class, but doesn't override these
		methods is following this mindset.
		
		Using these methods is considered an "unsafe" action, and will result in
		undefined behavior under this context. Please keep this in mind.
